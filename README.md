Documents russian ghost towns, mapping anomalies, ZATO cities. I am not sure of how far i'll go with this project.
I wanted to make a website but had no idea how so i figured i'll just use some tricks on github. 

This list will document Russian/Soviet ghost towns, ZATO cities and mapping anomalies.

I have barelly any idea of how gitHub warks so i'll probably do many mistakes.
